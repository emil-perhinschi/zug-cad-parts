... because I have no clue where to find non-gigantic clamps, extremely plain corner brackets and other such parts


CAD (FreeCAD, Openscad etc.) files for parts I needed printed, optimized to print fast on poorly tuned FDM printers

Everything should print without problems at 0.3 mm layer height, 60 speed.

So far:
 - bolt
 - nut 
 - clamp 
 - plain corner brackets
